## Usage

The Sorting and Searching Visualizer provides a user-friendly interface to explore various sorting and searching algorithms. Upon opening the application, you will be presented with a randomly generated array of elements.

To visualize a sorting algorithm, select the desired algorithm from the dropdown menu and click the "Sort" button. The visualizer will then demonstrate the step-by-step execution of the chosen algorithm, rearranging the elements in real-time.

Similarly, to visualize a searching algorithm, select the desired algorithm and enter the value you wish to search for. The visualizer will highlight the process of traversing the dataset and locating the specified value.

You can adjust the speed of the visualization using the provided slider or pause/resume the animation at any point for a closer examination.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: The visualizer currently supports the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- **Searching Algorithms**: The visualizer includes the following searching algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the algorithms in action with a dynamic and animated visual representation.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the visualization to better understand each step.
- **Pause and Resume**: Pause the animation at any point and resume when ready.
- **Random Data Generation**: Generate random datasets to experiment with different scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The entire project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: The core logic and functionality of the visualizer are implemented using JavaScript.
- **HTML/CSS**: The user interface and styling are created with HTML and CSS.
- **BootStrap**: For creating components Bootstrap is used.
